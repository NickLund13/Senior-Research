 In my project I will be attempting to crack the 20 most common passwords with John the ripper. 
 I will hash the passwords with md5 and bcrypt. I will use a brute force and a word list attack method and compare the results. 
 The objective of this  project is to show how ineffective common/ bad passwords are.
